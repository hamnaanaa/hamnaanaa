### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hamudi! I'm a Lebanese-born, Ukraine-raised, and Germany-educated AI researcher in Silicon Valley.

I've dedicated the last five years to exploring the intersections of generative AI across text, audio, images, and 3D. I love building scalable software and I'm passionate about transformative products that tackle real-world challenges.
