### Hi there 👋

My name is Hamudi. I'm an AI researcher and computer science graduate student at Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. 

My research and development interests are all about finding ways to integrate state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence solutions into applied software engineering to solve exciting real-world challenges.

💬 Feel free to ask me anything about:

  * Machine Learning R&D and its application in:
    * Generative AI (LLMs and Diffusion models)
    * Computer Vision (AR/VR/SLAM)
    * Autonomous Driving
    
  * Scalable Software Engineering, especially in the context of:
    * iOS Development
