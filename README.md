### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hamudi. I'm a computer science graduate student at Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. 

My research and development interests are all about finding ways to integrate state-of-the-art Machine Learning solutions into applied software engineering to make Machine Learning useful in solving real-world challenges.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything about:

  * Machine Learning and its application in:
    * Computer Vision (AR/VR/SLAM)
    * Autonomous Driving
    
  * Scalable Software Engineering, especially in the context of:
    * iOS Development
    
  * Ethereum Smart Contracts
